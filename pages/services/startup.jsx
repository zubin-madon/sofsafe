              Our goal is to help startups optimize the value of seed funding.
              To accomplish this, we provide expertise and mentoring that
              enables a startup to begin its journey with a culture of technical
              excellence, the kind of culture found at companies like Amazon. We
              help founders hire a development team that fits their unique
              post-launch operational needs and budget. At the same time, we
              take a technical lead role in solutions architecture, writing
              code, and mentoring your new team on technical matters as well as
              the day-to-day processes for software development. We do not ask
              for any equity in your business.

                  budget. You pay 50% of our hourly rates while we are actively
                  developing your product. Then, when you get more funding or
                  start bringing in revenue, you pay us the remaining 50%. We do
                  not charge interest and only do this for ideas we believe have
                  a good chance of success, or ideas we believe will have a
